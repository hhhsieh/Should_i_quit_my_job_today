    <p>
      This is a humorous interactive website created for people who quietly think about quitting their jobs every single day—yet keep showing up anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project features a Game Boy–inspired “resignation decision machine” (a minimalist slot simulation using randomized O and X symbols), a public leaderboard of anonymous resignation reasons, a rage-post wall, and a client-side mini game that lets users upload a photo and virtually “punch” it (purely local, nothing gets uploaded or stored).
    </p>

    <p>
      This website was designed and developed as an experimental project combining interface design, user interaction, and emotional observation. No logins, no tracking, no monetized features—just a strange little space for shared frustration and micro-catharsis.
    </p>

    <p>
      I didn’t study design or computer science formally. I simply got curious, started learning, and eventually ended up building things myself. This site is a result of self-directed learning—figuring things out through late-night research, trial and error, and an increasingly obsessive attention to small emotional details.
    </p>

    <p class="footer-note">
      If you actually end up quitting your job after visiting this site—please don’t blame me. I’m just the website.
    </p>

      This isn’t a startup pitch or a career switch narrative. I just opened VSCode and never closed it.

      Feel free to share the site, but any unauthorized reproduction or commercial use is not allowed.  I built this as a weird emotional outlet, not a business toolkit.
